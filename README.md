# Exporatory-Data-Analysis-with-SQL
In this project we perform an exploratory data analysis using SQL with a data downloaded from Real World Fake Data and we visualize it using Tableau
You can download the data using this link: https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Hospital+ER.csv

The steps we followed include;
1. Download our dataset
2. Import the dataset to MySQL workbench
3. Perform EDA
4. Visualize it with Tableau.
